 # AR Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the AR (Augmented Reality) project using `ar.js` and a Flask app. This project allows you to display augmented reality content directly within your web browser. The project includes a Makefile with specific commands to set up the development environment and run the application locally.

## Project Overview
AR is a project that leverages `ar.js` for augmented reality capabilities and Flask as the backend server to serve the necessary files. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform for creating and viewing augmented reality content through web browsers.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- Git installed (optional but useful for version control)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ar.git
    cd ar
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies using pip:
    ```sh
    make setup-dev
    ```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project
To run the project locally, use the following command:
```sh
make dev
```
This will start the Flask server and serve the application on `http://localhost:5000`. Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to see the augmented reality content.

## Makefile Commands
The Makefile includes several commands to facilitate development:
- **`setup-dev`**: Creates a virtual environment and installs all required Python packages.
    ```sh
    make setup-dev
    ```

- **`dev`**: Runs the Flask application in development mode.
    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

- **Other Commands**: The Makefile might include other commands for linting, testing, and cleaning up the environment. Check the Makefile for more details.
